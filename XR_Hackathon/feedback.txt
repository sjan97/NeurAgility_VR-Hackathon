WORKOUT SUMMARY:
{'total_reps': 3, 'avg_knee_angle': 144.8, 'avg_elbow_angle': 110.2, 'min_knee_angle': 78.9, 'min_elbow_angle': 50.5}

FEEDBACK:
Great job pushing through those reps! To maximize your squat effectiveness and protect your knees, focus on initiating the movement by pushing your hips back as if you're sitting into a chair, ensuring your chest stays up. This will help you achieve a deeper, more controlled descent.
